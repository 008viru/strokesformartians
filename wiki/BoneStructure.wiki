= Bone structure information =

  * Bone transformations are defined in global space.
  * Bone animations are defined as the transformation matrix that transforms the rest pose coordinate system into the animation pose coordinate system.
  * The animation is defined as one transformation matrix for each bone for each frame.
  * Each vertex has one or more nonzero weights corresponding to nearby bones.
  * The weights must sum to one.
  * The bone structure has a rest pose.

== Equations ==
=== Bone animation transformation ==
r_t: rest transformation

a_t: animation transformation (for a frame)

t: transformation from r_t to a_t

r_t * t = a_t

t = r_t^-1 * a_t

=== Skinning transformation ===
Example transformation for skinning a vertex with two bones affecting it.

t_0: transformation from restpose to animation pose for bone 0

t_1: transformation from restpose to animation pose for bone 1

p_0: root position for bone 0
